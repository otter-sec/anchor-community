# GAMMA

Goose Automated Market Making Algorithm (GAMMA) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol built on Solana. It provides dynamic fee AMM functionality with customizable fee structures and liquidity pool management.

## Key Features

- Migration tool for to transfer LP position from other AMMs
- Referral program and open source code
- Token2022 support
- Highly CU optimized for faster swaps
- $GOFX revenue share and burn mechanism (see docs.goosefx.io for more info)

## Developer Features

- Create and manage AMM configurations
- Initialize liquidity pools
- Deposit and withdraw liquidity
- Swap tokens with base input or base output
- Oracle price feed integration
- Transfer fee handling for SPL tokens (Token22 support)

## Project Structure

- `programs/gamma`: Solana program (smart contract) code
- `client`: Rust client for interacting with the Gamma program

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo
- Solana CLI tools
- Anchor framework

### Building

To build the project:
```bash
cargo make build_all
```

### Deploying

To deploy the program:
```bash
cargo make deploy_program
```

### Running the Client

The client provides a command-line interface for interacting with the Gamma program. Use the following command to see available options:
```bash
cargo install --path client
```

## Commands
```bash
gamma-cli --help
```

- `create-config`: Create a new AMM configuration
- `initialize-pool`: Initialize a new liquidity pool
- `init-user-pool-liquidity`: Initialize user pool liquidity account
- `deposit`: Deposit liquidity into a pool
- `withdraw`: Withdraw liquidity from a pool
- `swap-base-in`: Perform a token swap with a specified input amount
- `swap-base-out`: Perform a token swap with a specified output amount


### Testing

To run the test suite:
```bash
cargo test-sbf
```


> Note: Do not use `cargo update`, it adds some unwanted dependency version which then causes the compilation to fail.
At the time of writing this, it was adding multiple version of solana-sdk and borsh and then the jupiter-library and the external anchor providers we have for those the compilation was failing. If you want to check if the project is compiling its better to use `cargo check`
