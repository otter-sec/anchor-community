//! Per-IP rate limiting for warp routes.
//!
//! Wraps the `governor` crate in a warp filter directly, since warp does
//! not compose with tower layers as ergonomically as axum.
//!
//! # Trust model
//!
//! Client IP is read from `cf-connecting-ip` (trusted when present) and
//! falls back to the peer socket address. This is safe *only* under the
//! invariant that the origin is reachable exclusively through
//! Cloudflare, enforced at the infrastructure layer (security group /
//! WAF / network ACL). If that invariant ever breaks, a client reaching
//! the origin directly can spoof `cf-connecting-ip` to a fresh value
//! per request and obtain a brand-new bucket each time, effectively
//! bypassing the limiter. This is an **accepted risk**: the code does
//! not re-enforce the invariant (e.g. by IP-allowlisting Cloudflare
//! edges) — maintaining an in-code list of CF ranges is operationally
//! brittle and we rely on the network layer instead.
//!
//! # Keyed-store memory
//!
//! `DashMapStateStore` does not evict on its own. [`spawn_limiter_gc`]
//! must be called once per limiter at startup to periodically drop
//! entries whose buckets have fully refilled (equivalent to "this IP
//! currently has no rate-limit state to remember"). Without it, the
//! map grows with every unique observed IP until process restart.
//!
//! # Future work
//!
//! When/if this API migrates to axum, replace with
//! `tower_governor::GovernorLayer` for a cleaner middleware layer.
