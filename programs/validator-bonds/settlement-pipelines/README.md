# Settlement Pipelines

Set of CLI binaries that work as a pipeline for off-chain
management of the [Validator Bonds Program](../programs/validator-bonds/README.md).

## Provided Commands

- [init-settlement](./src/bin/init_settlement.rs): Creates `Settlement` accounts on-chain from the provided JSON.
- [list-claimable-epoch](./src/bin/list_claimable_epoch.rs): Prints a list of epochs that contain `Settlement`s which can be claimed.
- [claim-settlement](./src/bin/claim_settlement.rs): Searches on-chain for settlements to be claimed and claims them based on the provided JSONs with Merkle proofs.
- [list-settlement](./src/bin/list_settlement.rs): Derives `Settlement` account addresses from the provided JSON files and prints them.
- [close-settlement](./src/bin/close_settlement.rs): Checks the chain for `Settlement`s that can be closed and resets stake accounts,
  using the provided list of `Settlement` addresses to search for the settlement stake authorities.
- [fund-settlement](./src/bin/fund_settlement.rs): Funds the `Settlement` accounts from the Bonds account based on data loaded by `init-settlement`.
- [merge-stakes](./src/bin/merge_stakes.rs): Merges stake accounts that belong to the same validator bond.
- [verify-settlement](./src/bin/verify_settlement.rs): Load all available `Settlement`'s on-chain
  and compares them to provided list of Settlement addresses (expected they were loaded from gcloud).
  It returns a list of Settlements found on-chain but not available from the gcloud listing.

## Pipeline Usage

There are 6 pipelines used for the binary commands.

- [init-settlements](../.buildkite/init-settlements.yml): Initializes settlements for an epoch based on generated JSON files.
- [fund-settlements](../.buildkite/fund-settlements.yml): Funds the `Settlement` accounts from the Bonds account based on settlement data.
- [claim-settlements](../.buildkite/claim-settlements.yml): Claims settlements when possible.
  It is executed as a cron job once at a set interval. It checks the on-chain state to see if any settlements can be claimed.
  The settlement can be claimed within the time range of `Settlement Creation + non-claimable slots` to `Settlement Creation Epoch - Config claimable epoch`.
- [close-settlements](../.buildkite/close-settlements.yml): Closes `Settlement` and `SettlementClaims` accounts,
  and resets the state of stake accounts to be associated back to the validator `Bond` when not claimed.
- [merge-stakes](../.buildkite/merge-stakes.yml): Merges stake accounts that belong to the same validator bond.
- [verify-settlements](../.buildkite/verify-settlements.yml): Loading `Settlement` merkle tree data
  from gcloud and checking if the on-chain state does not contain some unknown `Settlement` in comparison
  to gcloud list.

## Usage

```bash
cargo run --bin <name>
```
